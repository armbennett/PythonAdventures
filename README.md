# PythonAdventures

Python Adventures is a microworld designed by Alex Hadwen-Bennett at King's College London to enable learners to learn the basics of programming through the creation of interactive stories and text-based adventures. It is free to use; however, it is also very much a work in progress and therefore I cannot provide any guarantees regarding its reliability.

An introduction to Python Adventures can be found on [my blog](http://physicalcomputing.co.uk/2020/11/25/python-adventures/).

There is also an introduction to the snowflake module on [my blog](http://physicalcomputing.co.uk/2020/12/03/programming-snowflakes/).
